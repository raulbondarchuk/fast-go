## **Features**
- **Quick Setup**: Minimal configuration required for a seamless build process.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Build binaries for both Linux and Windows environments.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Automatically locates and updates configuration files (e.g., `toml`, `yaml`) during the build process.
- **Customizable**: Easily set source files, output directories, and filenames.
- **Easy Integration**: Embed `Fast-Go Builder` in your existing projects for streamlined builds.

## **Example Usage**

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/raulbondarchuk/fast-go/builder"
)

func Build() {
	builderConfig := builder.BuildConfig{
		DefaultMode:      "dev", // For expample: local, dev, prod 
		OutputFilename:   "my-app-build",
		OutputDir:        "./",
		SourceFile:       "./cmd/main.go",
		BuildLinux:       true,
		BuildWindows:     false,
		PossibleDirs:     []string{"", "configs", "cfg", "config", "internal/config"},
		ConfigExtensions: []string{"toml", "yaml"},
	}
	builderConfig.Run()
}
```

You can integrate this build functionality in your `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	build "api/pkg/build"
	"api/internal/app"
	"flag"
)

func main() {
	// Define a flag for the build command
	buildFlag := flag.Bool("build", false, "Run the build process")
	flag.Parse()

	if *buildFlag {
		build.Build()
	} else {
		app.Run()
	}
}
```

## **Installation**

To install the library, ensure you have Go **1.19** or higher installed.

1. Initialize your Go module if not already done:
   ```bash
   go mod init <your_project_name>
   ```

2. Add the Fast-Go Builder library to your project:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/raulbondarchuk/fast-go/builder
   ```

3. Import the library in your code:
   ```go
   import "github.com/raulbondarchuk/fast-go/builder"
   ```

---

## **How to Use**

1. **Define Build Configuration:**
   Configure the `BuildConfig` struct with your project's details:
   - **DefaultMode**: Define the mode (`dev`, `prod`, or `local`).
   - **OutputFilename**: Set the output binary name.
   - **OutputDir**: Specify the output directory (default includes a timestamped "builds" folder).
   - **SourceFile**: Specify the main Go file for building.
   - **BuildLinux/BuildWindows**: Enable builds for Linux or Windows platforms.
   - **PossibleDirs/ConfigExtensions**: Define where to look for configuration files.

2. **Run the Build Process:**
   Call `Run()` to execute the build process.

3. **Optional Integration with CLI:**
   Add build functionality to your project CLI using flags, as shown in the example.

---

## **Output**
- Compiled binaries are stored in the `builds` directory within your specified `OutputDir`.
- Configuration files are updated with the current mode and copied alongside the binaries.
